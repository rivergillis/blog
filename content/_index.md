### Computers etcetera

Hey there, it looks like you've found my blog! I'm a software engineer with experience in games and graphics. Here's a picture of me so that you know that I am a real person:

Close enough.

I also enjoy photography and other creative stuff. Maybe one day I'll post those artifacts here. Don't count on it though.

You can find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/rivergillis) or contact me directly [here](mailto:jrivergillis@gmail.com).

If you're looking for rstftc, you can find it [here](rstftcv1.zip).
