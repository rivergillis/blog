### Computers etcetera

Hey there, it looks like you've found my blog! I'm a software engineer with experience in games and graphics. Right now I'm studying at the University of Arkansas. Here's a picture of me so that you know that I am a real person:

Close enough.

I also enjoy photography and other creative stuff. Maybe one day I'll post those artifacts here. Don't count on it though, this blog will mostly be used for my great opinions and occasionally things I've learned about software development.

You can find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/rivergillis) or contact me directly [here](mailto:jrivergillis@gmail.com).

If you're looking for rstftc, you can find it [here](rstftcv1.zip).
